# Compiler Design

This repository contains the implementation of a custom compiler, developed as part of a project to explore language design and compilation techniques.

## Contents

The repository includes the following components:

- **Grammar Definition**: The grammar for the custom language is implemented using ANTLR, defining the syntactic structure of the language.
- **Lexical and Syntax Analysis**: ANTLR is used to generate a lexer and parser based on the defined grammar, allowing for the tokenization and syntactic analysis of source code.
- **Name and Type Analysis**: Java is used to implement semantic checks, including name resolution and type analysis, ensuring the correctness
